## Synopsis

This project takes raw data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
and tidies it up. 

## Code Example

# This R script does the following:
 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard
    deviation for each measurement.
 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the
    data set
 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of
   each variable for each activity and each subject.
